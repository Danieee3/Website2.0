          <h2 class="content-title">What Is a Web Server?</h2>
          <p>A web server is nothing but software and hardware that uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, commonly known as HTTP, and some other protocols that respond to request from clients made on the World Wide Web. The main job that the webserver performs is to display the content of the website, which it does by storing, then processing, and eventually delivering the webpages to the user who has requested it. The web server also supports Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP and File Transfer Protocol or FTP and HTTP. These are used to transfer files for emailing and even for storage.<br><br>The web server hardware gets connected to the internet, allowing the exchange of data with the other devices related to it. The web server software controls how the user assesses the files that have been hosted. The web server process is basically a client and server model example. All the computers that host websites should have the webserver software. Web serves find use in web hosting or the hosting of data for websites as well as for all kinds of web-based applications. This is the complete explanation of what is a web server.</p>

        	<h2 class="content-title">How Does a Web Server Work?</h2>
        	<p>The web server software gets accessed using the domain name of a website. This then ensures that the content of the site gets delivered to the user who has requested it. The software part of the webserver is also made up of various components and has at least a single HTTP server. The HTTP server understands the URLs and the HTTP.<br><br>The web server hardware is basically a computer that will store the webserver software as well as the files that are related to the website. These include documents, HTML, JavaScript files, and images.<br><br>When any web browser, say Firefox or Google Chrome, requests for a file that is hosted on the web server, the browser will ask for the file using HTTP. The web server receives the right, and then the HTTP server accepts the request. It finds the content asked for and sends it using HTTP back to the browser.</p>

					<h3>Send and receive emails.</h3>
					<p>With the click of a mouse button, you can send an email from one point of the globe to another in a matter of seconds. Most of us take this process for granted, giving little thought to how it actually works. It’s easy to understand how standard snail-mail gets from point A to point B – but how does an email message make its way from a sender to a recipient? The answer to that question revolves around something called a mail server. You can learn more about the role that mail serves play in email delivery by reading on below.</p>

					<h3>Downloading Requests For FTP</h3>
					<p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol for transmitting files between computers over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connections. Within the TCP/IP suite, FTP is considered an application layer protocol.In an FTP transaction, the end user's computer is typically called the local host. The second computer involved in FTP is a remote host, which is usually a server. Both computers need to be connected via a network and configured properly to transfer files via FTP.</p>

					<h3>Creating And Publishing Webpages</h3>
					<p>In order to publish content on the web, you need three things: 1) web development software, 2) an Internet connection, and 3) a web server. The software may be a professional web design program like Dreamweaver or a simple web-based interface like WordPress. The Internet connection serves as the medium for uploading the content to the web server. Large sites may use a dedicated web host, but many smaller sites often reside on shared servers, which host multiple websites. Most blogs are published on public web servers through a free service like Blogger.</p>

				<p class="paragraph-text">A web server is used to store and to deliver the website content. These could be images, texts, application data, videos, and many more as per the request of the client. The web browser asks for data from the website, which happens when the user clicks on a particular link or clicks to download a document that has been displayed on the browser. Read below to understand what is a web server is in detail.<br><br><h2 class="content-title">Conclusion</h2>A web server is capable of hosting a single website or many websites with the help of the same software and hardware resource. This is called virtual hosting. The answer to what is the role of a web server is here. Web servers are also capable of limiting the speed of the response to various clients, which in turn does not allow a single client to dominate the resources. This is used to satisfy the requests of many clients.<br><br>The web servers will typically host the websites that are internet accessible. These can also be used to communicate between the web clients and the servers in the local network area. This could be like through the intranet of a company. The web server could be embedded in a device like a digital camera. This lets the users communicate with the device using a commonly available web browser.</p>
